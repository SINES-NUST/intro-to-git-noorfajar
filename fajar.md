## Learning Outcomes
I have learned about repositories and their usage. It can store and share your code and also help collaborate with other developers.
I have theoretically understood the concept of cloning. It is used to make a copy on your  computer of some project or file on github.
I have also learnt how to commit changes. They help keep track of the history of your code.
I have also understood the importance of git.
## New Concepts
### Push
### Pull
### Repositories
### Branches
### Cloning
### Forking
## Confusions
I have theoretically understood the concept of push and pull but haven't yet been able to connect my VScode with github yet. So I still have confusion if it is just pushing the commiteds changes from my PC to remote github repository, or the syncing of changes on github codespace is the same concept too? Would appreciate help understanding these further.
I would further like to see how to access opensource codes and explore codes from git community for practice.
